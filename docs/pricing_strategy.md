# Pricing Strategy

Our pricing strategy is designed to be competitive in the market while ensuring profitability. Key points include:

- **Cost-based Pricing**: Prices are set based on cost of goods sold, with a fixed markup.
- **Tiered Pricing**: Discounts based on purchase volume (e.g., buy 2 get 10% off).
- **Market Penetration Pricing**: Lower initial pricing to attract new customers.
