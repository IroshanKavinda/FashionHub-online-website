# Technology Stack Justification

We selected the following technologies based on scalability, maintainability, and cost-efficiency:

- **Frontend**: React.js (High-performance, scalable, rich UI)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (Fast, lightweight, and supports JavaScript throughout the stack)
- **Database**: MongoDB (Flexible schema for rapid development)
- **Cloud**: AWS (Reliable, cost-effective cloud hosting)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (Automates build, test, and deployment pipelines)

### Scalability & Maintainability Considerations
- **React**: Reusable components and fast rendering for scalability.
- **Node.js**: Event-driven architecture for handling large numbers of requests.
- **MongoDB**: Horizontal scalability for handling large amounts of data.
