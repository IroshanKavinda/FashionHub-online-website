# Security & Compliance Considerations

## Security Practices
- **SSL Encryption**: All data transmitted will be encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Used for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: To protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

## Compliance
- **GDPR**: The platform will ensure compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR.
- **PCI-DSS**: If we handle payments, we will ensure our system meets PCI-DSS standards.
